greyd.conf(5) -- greyd configuration file
=========================================

## SYNOPSIS

This configuration file is read by **greyd**, **greydb**, **greylogd** and **greyd-setup**.

## DESCRIPTION

The syntax consists of sequences of assignments, each terminated by a newline:

    # A string value.
    variable = "value"

    # A number value.
    variable = 10  # Another comment.

    # A list value may contain strings or numbers.
    # Trailing commas are allowed.
    variable = [ 10, "value", ]

Comments, whitespace and blank lines are ignored.

*Sections* may contain many assignments, separated by a newline.

    section sectionname {
        var1 = "val1"
        var2 = 10
        var3 = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
    }

*Blacklists* and *whitelists* use the same syntax as the *section* above (see [BLACKLIST CONFIGURATION][]):

    blacklist blacklistname {
        ...
    }

    whitelist whitelistname {
        ...
    }

Configuration may also be recursively loaded by way of an *include*:

    # Globbing is supported.
    include "/etc/greyd/conf.d/*.conf"

## BLACKLIST CONFIGURATION

A blacklist must contain the following fields:

* **method** = *string*:
  The method in which the list of addresses is fetched. This may be one of *http*, *ftp*, *exec* or *file*.

* **file** = *string*:
  The argument to the specified *method*. For example, if the *http* method is specified, the *file* refers to the URL (minus the protocol).

An example blacklist definition is as follows:

    blacklist nixspam {
        message = "Your address %A is in the nixspam list"
        method  = "http"
        file = "www.openbsd.org/spamd/nixspam.gz"
    }

### Whitelist definitions

Whitelist definitions take the same fields as a blacklist definition, with the exception of the *message* (which is not applicable). For example:

    whitelist work_clients {
        method = "exec"
        file = "cat /tmp/work-clients-traplist.gz"
    }

### Address format

The format of the list of addresses is expected to consist of one network block or address per line (optionally followed by a space and text that is ignored). Comment lines beginning with # are ignored. Network blocks may be specified in any of the formats as in the following example:

    # CIDR format
    192.168.20.0/24
    # A start - end range
    192.168.21.0 - 192.168.21.255
    # As a single IP address
    192.168.23.1

Note, currently only IPv4 addresses are supported.
